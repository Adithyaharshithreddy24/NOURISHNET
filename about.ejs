            <h1>About NourishNet:</h1>
            <p class="a1">Linking Surplus to Support</p><br>
            <p>At NourishNet, we believe that food should never go to waste while people go hungry. Every day,
                restaurants, hotels, event venues, and gatherings produce surplus food that often ends up in landfills.
                At the same time, countless individuals, including the homeless, orphans, and elderly, struggle to find
                their next meal. This imbalance inspired us to create a platform that connects food donors with NGOs,
                volunteers, and communities in need, ensuring that excess food is rescued and redirected to those who
                need it the most.</p><br><br>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2><br>
            <p>Our mission is to build a sustainable and efficient network that reduces food waste and fights hunger.
                By leveraging technology, we provide a seamless way for food donors to register excess food, for
                volunteers to transport meals, and for NGOs to receive and distribute food effectively. Through this
                collaborative effort, we aim to make surplus food a lifeline rather than a waste product.</p><br>
            <h2>How NourishNet Works</h2><br>
            <p>NourishNet functions as a three-way bridge between food donors, volunteers, and NGOs, ensuring food is
                collected and distributed in the most efficient way possible:</p>
            <ul id="ul1">

                    <li>They provide details such as quantity, freshness, and pickup location.</li>
                    <li>The platform matches the food with NGOs or available volunteers for distribution.</li>
